# NeXUS-raylib

A work in progress port of a work in progress fantasy console. Basically
porting NeXUS to raylib so we don't have to deal with LOVE2D overhead.

The system font is [Matchup Pro][] by [Eeve Somepx][], used with attribution
because holy cow it's a really good font go support Eeve you won't regret it.

## To run

Don't. (Right now.)

Use the solution in the `projects/VS2022` directory to build if on Windows, otherwise use `make` in the `src` directory.
